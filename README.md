With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, computer vision, as one of its core fields, is gradually changing our way of life and work patterns. Image classification, as a fundamental task in computer vision, aims to automatically recognize and distinguish objects or scenes of different categories based on image content. In recent years, the introduction of deep learning technology has greatly promoted the progress of image classification technology, among which Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the mainstream method in the field of image classification due to their powerful feature extraction ability and generalization performance.
The Alex Net model proposed in 2012 has shown good performance in image classification. Alex Net applies CNN to deeper and wider networks based on Le Net, learning deeper image features. Many experts at home and abroad have conducted research on it and made certain progress. Qiao et al. used a combination of convolutional neural networks and support vector machines for image recognition and classification, but the recognition effect was not significant in complex backgrounds; Cui et al. achieved image recognition and classification by combining improved VG GNet and Focal Loss algorithms, which improved the problem that shallow networks cannot improve performance. However, transfer learning and other methods are needed to overcome the problem of overfitting. Luo et al. proposed a multi-scale fusion attention mechanism network. Chen et al. proposed an attention pyramid convolutional residual network model based on the residual network (Res Net).
This article focuses on the research of image classification based on AlexNet convolutional neural network, and specifically selects the CIFAR-10 dataset as the experimental object, aiming to explore the applicability, performance, and possible optimization strategies of AlexNet network architecture on small-scale datasets. Through in-depth analysis of the network structure of AlexNet, the aim is to reveal how AlexNet extracts effective image features from the CIFAR-10 dataset with limited computing resources and achieves high-precision classification results..
